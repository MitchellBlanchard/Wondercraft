Hello lovely TA!

We just wanted to leave you the controls and basic game rules so that you can have the best player experience possible. We hope you enjoy your journey through the wonderful wonderverse of wondercraft. 
			- With Love, 
				The Wondercrew <3 <3 <3
Controls:  
 - Left and Right arrows: Move the player left and right respectively
 - Up arrow: Jump

 - Spacebar: Attack with a spell
 - I: pause the game and open up your inventory and crafting menu (use arrow keys and enter to navigate) 

Your goal in Wondercraft is to adventure through the worlds without being eliminated by the monsters you will find along the way.  Progress through a level by travelling right.  If you shoot monsters, they will take damage, and if a monster takes enough damage, it will die.  However, if you come into contact with a monster it will hurt you. If you lose enough health, you will die.

Items that will help you can be found throughout your journey.  Potions will restore life, and other items to be found are stones and equipment. Stones can be combined to create gems, and gems can be slotted into equipment to grant you new spells, and alter your stats.
